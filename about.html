<h1> About Me </h1>

    My name is Garrett Burrus and I am a sophmore computer science major at the University of Rhode Island. I was born in Newport Beach, CA and I grew up in Irvine, CA. Prior to this academic school year I had no experience in computer science or computer programming. I choose computer science over other fields of study due to the importance of computer science in todays day and age. In addition I have always had a huge interest in computers and how they work which is why I feel this is the perfect field for me. I hope you enjoy viewing my computing profile!.
